* -v 
    -> is concise and good for simple mounts, but less clear and flexible
    docker run -v /host/data:/container/data myimage

* --mount 
    -> is more complex but offers greater clarity and flexibility for complex scenarios
    docker run --mount type=bind,source=<host_path>,target=<container_path> ...


    * Docker volumes

    = mechanisms for persisting data used by Docker containers
    the file / directory is stored in a new directory within Doker's storage directory on the host machine
    => completely managed by docker

    - volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
    - you can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
    - volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
    - volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
    - volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, encrypt the contents of volumes, or add other functionality.
    - new volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.
    - volumes on Docker Desktop have much higher performance than bind mounts from Mac and Windows hosts.


* Bind Mounts

    a file/directory on the host machine is mounted into a container
    the file / directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine

    If you use -v or --volume to bind-mount a file or directory that does not yet exist on the Docker host, -v creates the endpoint for you. It is always created as a directory.

    If you use --mount to bind-mount a file or directory that does not yet exist on the Docker host, Docker does not automatically create it for you, but generates an error.


    ### docker exec sample-app sh -c "ls /usr/share/nginx/html"

    docker exec: This command is used to run a command in a running container.

    sample-app: This is the name (or ID) of the running container in which you want to execute the command. The container must be running for docker exec to work.

    sh -c "ls /usr/share/nginx/html": This is the command being executed inside the container.

    sh: This starts a shell session in the container.
    -c: This flag tells the shell to execute the command that follows in quotes.
    ls /usr/share/nginx/html: This lists the contents of the directory /usr/share/nginx/html within the container
